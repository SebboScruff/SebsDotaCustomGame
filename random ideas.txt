Collection/List of Miscellaneous Ideas for the Custom Game
This list will be added to as and when I get any (probably) dumb ideas
==================================================================================================================

- Mars Arena gets gradually smaller, e.g. -100 radius/second
      - Arena segments can be attacked an destroyed/Attacks going through arena wall are reduced by Bulwark%
      
- Bloodseeker Aghs changed to continually fear enemy heroes around him & grant bonus thirst MS instead of heal

- Vector Targeted Fissure with Shaker Aghs

- Gyro & Medusa: Put Flak Functionality onto Medusa Splitshot (i.e. active w/ cooldown to attack everything in range for X hits at 100% damage); turn side gunner into normal spell:
      -Toggle: 1.4/1.2/1.0/0.8s delay for instant attack dealing 50/60/70/80% Damage on random enemy in 700 range while toggled on, fully procs on-hits. Prioritises furthest unit in range.
      -Talent:  10R +300 Flak Range -> +15% Side Gunner Damage
                15L +2 Flak Hits -> +200 Side Gunner Range
                25R -6 Flak Cooldown -> -0.4s Side Gunner delay
      -Aghanim's: every 3rd side gunner hit attacks all units in range
