Collection/List of Miscellaneous Ideas for the Custom Game
This list will be added to as and when I get any (probably) dumb ideas
==================================================================================================================

- Mars Arena gets gradually smaller, e.g. -100 radius/second
      - Arena segments can be attacked an destroyed/Attacks going through arena wall are reduced by Bulwark%
      
- Bloodseeker Aghs changed to continually fear enemy heroes around him & grant bonus thirst MS instead of heal

- Vector Targeted Fissure with Shaker Aghs

- Gyro & Medusa: Put Flak Functionality onto Medusa Splitshot (i.e. active w/ cooldown to attack everything in range for X hits at 100% damage); turn side gunner into normal spell:
      -Toggle: Reduces damage by 35/30/25/20% to enable an automatic attack every 1.4/1.2/1.0/0.8s. This attack will hit the furthest unit in 700 range, fully proccing on-hits, and works while disabled, disarmed, and ethereal. Level 4 Side Gunner prioritises heroes for the attack
      -Talent:  10R +300 Flak Range -> -10% Side Gunner Damage Reduction
                15L +2 Flak Hits -> +200 Side Gunner Range
                25R -6 Flak Cooldown -> -0.4s Side Gunner delay
      -Aghanim's: Every 4th Side Gunner attack targets all enemies in range
      
     
- Sniper: Combine Headshot+Take Aim into one spell, give new spell in slot 2 TBD
