Collection/List of Miscellaneous Ideas for the Custom Game
This list will be added to as and when I get any (probably) dumb ideas
==================================================================================================================

- Mars Arena gets gradually smaller, e.g. -100 radius/second
      - Arena segments can be attacked an destroyed/Attacks going through arena wall are reduced by Bulwark%
      
- Bloodseeker Aghs changed to continually fear enemy heroes around him & grant bonus thirst MS instead of heal

- Vector Targeted Fissure with Shaker Aghs

- Gyro & Medusa: Put Flak Functionality onto Medusa Splitshot (i.e. active w/ cooldown to attack everything in range for X hits at 100% damage); turn side gunner into normal spell:
      -Toggle: Reduces damage by 35/30/25/20% to enable an automatic attack every 1.4/1.2/1.0/0.8s. This attack will hit the furthest unit in 700 range, fully proccing on-hits, and works while disabled, disarmed, and ethereal. Level 4 Side Gunner prioritises heroes for the attack
      -Talent:  10R +300 Flak Range -> -10% Side Gunner Damage Reduction
                15L +2 Flak Hits -> +200 Side Gunner Range
                25R -6 Flak Cooldown -> -0.4s Side Gunner delay
      -Aghanim's: Every 4th Side Gunner attack targets all enemies in range

- Revenant's Brooch Item Change:
      -Recipe: Witch Blade + Ghost Scepter + Mystic Staff + Recipe (400)
      -Grants 45 Intelligence, 5 Strength, 5 Agility, 7 Armor, 35 Attack Speed, 300 Projectile Speed
      -New Active: Toggle On to become ethereal and gain a buff that allows you to attack while ethereal, as well as attack ethereal units. Causes standard attacks to deal magical damage and have True Strike. Drains 2.5% of max mana per second while active.

- Helios Beacon: New Item
      - Recipe: Solar Crest + Glimmer Cape + Recipe (450)
      - Grants 2.5 Mana Regon, 20 Movement Speed, 8 Armor, 20% Magic Resist
      - When cast on an ally, grants them 8 armor, 50 attack speed, 10% movement speed, 25% magic resistance, and a 0.6s fade time invisibility. When cast on an enemy, removes 8 armor, 50 attack speed, 10% movement speed, 25% magic resistance, and grants True Sight over them. Lasts 12 seconds. Removes 6 armor and 10% magic resistance from the user when used.
      
- Duality Wand: New Item
      - Recipe: Holy Locket + Dagon 1 + Recipe (700)
      - Grants 10 Strength, 10 Agility, 20 Agility, 250 HP, 300 Mana
      - Aura: Grants 3.5 HP regen to allies within range. Amplifies heals you provide by 30%.
      - Greater Energy Charge: Gains a charge every 10 seconds and whenever a visible enemy within 1200 range uses an ability. Maximum 25 charges. Targets an ally to heal or an enemy to damage an amount of HP equal to 20 + 25 per charge. Instantly kills illusions.
      
- Shadow Fiend Hero Rework:
      - Shadowraze (Q,W,E): functionally the same, but now carries Necromastery as well. Hitting an enemy with Shadowraze marks them with a Shadowbrand, a stackable debuff that causes Nevermore to deal 5/7/9/11% more damage from any source to them per stack (max. 3 stacks). If Shadow Fiend kills an enemy with a Shadowbrand, he consumes their soul, empowering his other spells. Shadow Fiend can hold 6/12/18/24 souls total.
      - Presence of the Dark Lord (D): Nevermore's presence shakes the resolve of his enemies, reducing their damage by 0.6/0.8/1.0/1.2% per soul in his collection.
      - New Spell: Abyssal Wind (F; Autocast): Shadow Fiend brings forth a swirling storm from the Abysm for 0.25s per soul in his collection. If autocast is turned on, enemies will be pulled towards Nevermore; if turned off, they will be pushed away. While active, Shadowraze's Shadowbrand debuff additionally slows for 5/10/15/20% per stack. The wind direction dynamically changes if autocast is toggled while the spell is active.
      - Requiem of Souls: Functions the same as it currently does, minus the fear aspect.

- Sniper Hero Rework: 
      - Shrapnel (Q): Unchanged
      - Take Aim (W): Passively increases attack range. Can be activated to grant Bonus Damage, True Strike, and a Ministun on each attack, at the cost of 20% movement speed reduction
      - Concussive Grenade (E): Current Shard ability moved to regular skill slot. Deals 50/120/190/260 damage and disarms/slows for 3s.
      - Assassinate: Same functionality, cast time from 2->2/1.5/1
